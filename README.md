**Project Overview:**

WeSpark is a comprehensive full-stack application developed to demonstrate capabilities in modern software development practices and technologies. Conceived as a "Learning & Opportunity Dashboard," its primary goal is to showcase the creation of a system that collects, processes, and presents data relevant to identifying and fostering opportunities for growth and prosperity.

The system architecture comprises three interconnected components:

1.  **.NET MAUI Mobile Application:** A cross-platform mobile client enabling data input (e.g., ratings, textual feedback) related to learning experiences or opportunities.
2.  **Node.js & Express Backend API:** A RESTful API service responsible for receiving and persisting data submitted via the mobile application. Initial data storage is managed via a JSON file, with documented considerations for scalable cloud-based data solutions.
3.  **Angular Web Dashboard:** A single-page application (SPA) serving as an administrative and analytical interface. It allows for the visualization, searching, and interpretation of collected data, providing insights into potential areas for improvement or success.

This project highlights proficiency in full-stack development, modern mobile application architecture (as an evolution of Xamarin principles), and an understanding of cloud deployment strategies.

## üöÄ Technologies & Tool Stack

The WeSpark project leverages a robust and contemporary technology stack:

**1. Backend Service:**
    *   **Runtime/Language:** Node.js (`v18.x` or specified version) with JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   **Framework:** Express.js (`~4.18.x` or specified version)
    *   **Data Persistence (Initial):** Local JSON file, managed via Node.js `fs` module.
    *   **Package Manager:** npm (`v9.x` or specified version)

**2. Mobile Application:**
    *   **Framework:** .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI)
        *   *Based on:* .NET 7 (or specified .NET version)
    *   **Language:** C#
    *   **User Interface:** XAML
    *   **Key Architectural Concept:** Illustrates a contemporary approach to cross-platform native application development, succeeding Xamarin.Forms and enabling a single C# codebase for multiple targets.

**3. Web Dashboard (Frontend SPA):**
    *   **Framework:** Angular (`v16.x` or specified version)
    *   **Language:** TypeScript (`~5.1.x` or specified version)
    *   **Core Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3 (Optionally Angular Material `v16.x` for UI components)
    *   **Data Interaction:** Angular `HttpClientModule` for API communication.
    *   **Package Manager:** npm (`v9.x` or specified version), managed via Angular CLI.

**4. Version Control & Collaboration:**
    *   **System:** Git
    *   **Hosting Platform:** GitHub

**5. Development Environments:**
    *   **Primary IDEs:** Visual Studio Code (for Node.js/Angular, primarily within WSL Ubuntu `22.04 LTS` or specified version), Visual Studio 2022 (for .NET MAUI).
    *   **Operating System Flexibility:** The project supports development across Windows, macOS, and Linux, with this instance utilizing WSL for Linux-based development of backend/frontend components alongside Windows for .NET MAUI.

**6. Cloud Architecture Considerations (Backend Deployment Strategy):**
    The backend API is designed with scalability and cloud-native deployment in mind. A production deployment strategy would consider the following AWS services:
    *   **Compute Options:**
        *   **AWS Lambda:** For serverless function execution, suitable for event-driven API endpoints.
        *   **Amazon Elastic Beanstalk:** For managed deployment of the Node.js application.
        *   **Amazon EC2:** For direct virtual machine instances, offering granular control.
    *   **API Management:**
        *   **Amazon API Gateway:** To manage, secure, and expose API endpoints for Lambda, Beanstalk, or EC2.
    *   **Scalable Data Storage:**
        *   **Amazon DynamoDB:** A NoSQL database service for high-performance, scalable data storage.
        *   **Amazon S3:** For object storage, potentially for the JSON data file or associated assets.
        *   **Amazon RDS:** For relational database needs, if data complexity increases.
    *   **Security & Access Control:**
        *   **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management):** For fine-grained control over access to AWS resources.
        *   **Amazon VPC & Security Groups:** For network isolation and traffic filtering.
